## Updates


20/12/2019 We have uploaded the RGB features, trained models and evaluation results! We found that increasing the number of proposals to 800 in the testing
further boosts the performance on THUMOS14. We have also updated the proposal list.

04/07/2020 We have uploaded the I3D features on Anet, the training configurations files in data/dataset_cfg.yaml and the proposal lists for Anet.

# Usage Guide

## Prerequisites
[[back to top](#graph-convolutional-networks-for-temporal-action-localization)]

The training and testing in PGCN is reimplemented in PyTorch for the ease of use. 

- [PyTorch 1.0.1][pytorch]
                   
Other minor Python modules can be installed by running

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

 
 
## Code and Data Preparation
[[back to top](#graph-convolutional-networks-for-temporal-action-localization)]

### Get the code

Clone this repo with git, **please remember to use --recursive**

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Alvin-Zeng/PGCN
```

### Download Datasets

We support experimenting with two publicly available datasets for 
temporal action detection: THUMOS14 & ActivityNet v1.3. Here are some steps to download these two datasets.

- THUMOS14: We need the validation videos for training and testing videos for testing. 
You can download them from the [THUMOS14 challenge website][thumos14].
- ActivityNet v1.3: this dataset is provided in the form of YouTube URL list. 
You can use the [official ActivityNet downloader][anet_down] to download videos from the YouTube. 


### Download Features

Here, we provide the I3D features (RGB+Flow) for training and testing. 

THUMOS14: You can download it from [Google Cloud][features_google] or [Baidu Cloud][features_baidu].

Anet: You can download the I3D Flow features from [Baidu Cloud][features_baidu_anet_flow] (password: jbsa) 
and the I3D RGB features from [Google Cloud][features_google_anet_rgb] (Note: set the interval to 16 in ops/I3D_Pooling_Anet.py when training with RGB features)

### Download Proposal Lists (ActivityNet)

Here, we provide the proposal lists for ActivityNet 1.3. You can download them from [Google Cloud][anet_proposal_google]

## Training PGCN
[[back to top](#graph-convolutional-networks-for-temporal-action-localization)]

Plesse first set the path of features in data/dataset_cfg.yaml

```bash
train_ft_path: $PATH_OF_TRAINING_FEATURES
test_ft_path: $PATH_OF_TESTING_FEATURES
```


Then, you can use the following commands to train PGCN

```bash
python pgcn_train.py thumos14 --snapshot_pre $PATH_TO_SAVE_MODEL
```

After training, there will be a checkpoint file whose name contains the information about dataset and the number of epoch.
This checkpoint file contains the trained model weights and can be used for testing.

## Testing Trained Models
[[back to top](#graph-convolutional-networks-for-temporal-action-localization)]



You can obtain the detection scores by running 

```bash
sh test.sh TRAINING_CHECKPOINT
```

Here, `TRAINING_CHECKPOINT` denotes for the trained model.
This script will report the detection performance in terms of [mean average precision][map] at different IoU thresholds.

The trained models and evaluation results are put in the "results" folder.

You can obtain the two-stream results on THUMOS14 by running
```bash
sh test_two_stream.sh
```

### THUMOS14

| mAP@0.5IoU (%)                    | RGB   | Flow  | RGB+Flow      |
|-----------------------------------|-------|-------|---------------|
| P-GCN (I3D)                       | 37.23 | 47.42 | 49.07 (49.64) |


#####Here, 49.64% is obtained by setting the combination weights to Flow:RGB=1.2:1 and nms threshold to 0.32
